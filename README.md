# Facebook_Linkedin_Hybrid
The idea is to create a website targeted at large organizations with employees who feel out of touch at work. Work is a place that we spend â…“ of our lives and should be as personal as it is professional. Social media websites such as LinkedIn have proved to be invaluable to many companies as they try to find talent in the community and connect people socially through the genre of work. The idea is to do the same thing, but with more impact in a personal space. The site is poised to be somewhat of a Facebook LinkedIn hybrid. The site is primarily focused to be a company internal CRM (customer relationship management) system; I call it an Employee Community Network (ECN). From the site, you can connect with other company employees, post about your interests, showcase your talents, and even see what internal jobs are open within the company with our ECN job board. The site showcases the hobbies and passions of employees throughout the organization and allows co-workers to find fellow employees that share similar interests. Not only does this bring the entire company closer together, it also opens up possibilities for better collaboration at work as workers begin to build report with one another across the organization and building close ties.
